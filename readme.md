# Overview

This project is a simple “Hello World” application built in Dart. The purpose of this software is to demonstrate the basic structure of a Dart program, how to run it, and how the Dart runtime executes code.

As a software engineer, this project helps me strengthen my understanding of the Dart programming language and its development environment, which serves as the foundation for more complex applications such as Flutter mobile apps.
